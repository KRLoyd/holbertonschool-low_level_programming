First projects working with recursion in C.

0-puts_recursion.c -> write a function that prints a string, followed by \n;
1-print_rev_recursion.c -> write a function that prints a string in reverse;
2-strlen_recursion.c -> Write a function that returns the length of a string;
3-factorial.c -> Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number;
4-pow_recursion.c -> Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the
power of y;
5-sqrt_recursion.c -> Write a function that returns the natural square root of a
number;
6-is_prime_number.c -> Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a
prime number, otherwise return 0;
7-is_palindrome.c -> Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome
and 0 if not;
