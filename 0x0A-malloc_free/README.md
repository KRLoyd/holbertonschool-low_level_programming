What you should learn from this project:
1. What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation;
2. What is malloc and free and how to use them;
3. Why and when we use malloc;
4. How to use valgrind to check for memory leak;

Tasks:
0-create_array.c -> function to create an array of chars, and initialize w char;
1-strdup.c -> function that returns pointer to new string, dupe of given str;
2-str_concat.c -> write a function that concatenates two strings;
3-alloc_grid.c -> write a function that returns pointer to 2D array of ints;
4-free_grid.c -> write a funciton to free 2D array allocated by alloc_grid;
5-argstostr.c -> write a function that concatenates all args of program;
